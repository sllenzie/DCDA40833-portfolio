            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> This initial setup was pleasantly familiar, as I had prior experience with web development and portfolio creation from previous courses.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> With this initial setup, there seemed to be a disconnect between the CSS styling I wanted to include and the CSS styling that was being read, and portrayed through the live version of the website. I had to hunt through my CSS code and I found the one time the background color was not mentioend as a variable and was instead a hex code, and needed to remove it.</p>

        <!-- I will expand this section with more detailed reflections as needed -->
            <!--

            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
