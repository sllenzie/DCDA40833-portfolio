            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>First of all, this software is neither artificial, nor intelligent. There seems to be the misconception that AI can invent whatever you’re telling it, but what it is really doing is using a lot of data to try to fill in the blanks as best as likely possible for what you are asking of it. This lends itself particularly well when the user has an image in their head, or the vague idea of one, and is looking to generate an image that gets as close as possible to the desired outcome. This is what I decided to explore in this lab, was the image generation capabilities of various tools, where I gave them similar prompts and was searching for a similar image. Here, I’ll compare the style of art that each model generated, the overall quality of the image produced, and how closely it resembles something that the viewer might think immediately was generated by AI.</p>
            <p>As for the image that I want to be produced, I’m looking for a colonial-style house with white trim, red shutters, a black door, and a well-landscaped front yard. The three tools that I decided to utilize were Google Gemini’s NanoBanana, Venice.ai, and Leonardo.ai. The prompt given to all three was exactly as stated above, and proved to be a good baseline for all three models.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Google Gemini’s NanoBanana</h2>
            <p>It thought for a few seconds, before producing a fairly accurate image to what I had in mind. It got the shutters correct, the general style correct, and the black front door was in place. It added the distinctly colonial columns and overhang to the front of the house, which was a good move, and added a porch to the right side. Overall, not bad, though the image appears a bit tilted, and I did not want the exterior to be exposed brick.</p>
